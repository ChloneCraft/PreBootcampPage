# PreBootcampPage
This is a project that i did for learning purposes before my coding bootcamp

it is a tool to have a discussion.
1. you choose a root thesis that you want to discuss.
2. add pro and contra arguments
3. you can edit and delete them
4. if you click on one of the arguments it becomes the new thesis that you then can discuss agian with the same pro and contra concept
5. on the top you have a little overview on the argument tree(there is a bug when clicking on the root question

i taught myself html/css/javascript with this project so i will not continue working on this. 
I want to show this project as an indicator to give recruiters an idea of what i will be capable of after my 12 week coding bootcamp.
